# Usage

Documentation to come later. For now:
 - Select a Body in which to create infill
 - You can select a body and create an outer shell thickness plus infill.  This is most common.
 - Alternatively (for more complex geometry) you can manually create the "interior" body and then simply generate the infill pattern in this body.
 - Specify an outer wall (shell) thickness
 - Specify the rib thickness
 - Specify the "cell" size.  This is defined as the circumscribed circle diameter for a given cell.  Better documentation to come later.
 - Select the type of infill:
   - Hex
